          Ever since the beginning of my journey as a frontend developer, I have developed particular interests in React.js, Javascript and Framer Motion.
          After graduating with a degree in Marketing Management, I quickly discovered my passion for web development
          and the opportunity to combine technical problem
          solving with the ever-growing technology stacks energizes me to work with designers and businesses to bring their concepts to life.
          When I am not coding or studying, I love to spend my free time playing video games and watching crime TV shows.
