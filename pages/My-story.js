          Ever since the beginning of my journey as a frontend developer, I have
          developed particular interests in React.js, Javascript and Framer
          Motion. After graduating with a degree in Marketing Management, I
          quickly discovered my passion for web development and the opportunity
          to combine technical problem solving with the ever-growing technology
          stacks energizes me to work with designers and businesses to bring
          their concepts to life. When I am not coding or studying, I love to
          spend my free time going on hikes and playing video games.
