      Since the beginning of my journey as a frontend developer, I have developed particular interests in React.js, Javascript and Node.js
      Even before graduating with a degree in Marketing Management, I had quickly discovered my passion for web development
      and have been working towards becoming a professional developer one day. The opportunity to combine technical problem
      solving with the ever-growing technology landscape energizes me to work on many interesting projects in this field.
      When I am not coding or studying, I love to spend my free time playing video games and watching crime TV shows with friends.
      My other hobby is taking on Italian baking recipes because I have a sweet-tooth and they are perfect companions to the scarier crime shows.
